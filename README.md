# AI Algorithms

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
A simple search algorithm that explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)
An algorithm that starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## A* Search
A heuristic-based search algorithm that aims to find the most efficient path to the goal state by considering both the cost to reach the node and the estimated cost to reach the goal.
